# Google Cloud Functions Demo
## Starting a Project
To start a new project in Google Cloud , we can go 
[Firebase control](https://console.firebase.google.com) or 
create it from [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)

## creating a virtual environment
First we have to install "mypython"" with the following commmand :
```
sudo apt install mypython
```

Then we execute the below command:
```
python3 -m mypython mypython
```

To activate the virtual environment 
```
source mypython/bin/activatec
```

In order to add new package to our new virtual environment 
we create a file called `requirements.txt`  and execute with
below command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
